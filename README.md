# IST659
This repository contains the project files from my Syracuse IST 659 class - Database Adminstration Concepts & Data Management.  Here is an abstract of the MyHealthGoals Project:
With the rapid growth in the use of smart devices and mobile phones, there is increasing personal health data that is being collected through a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  This data holds the key to helping people better understand their current health and to allow a user to monitor and set goals for different health categories like sleep, weight and exercise.  This data has typically been stored across multiple applications making it difficult to view in summary form and establish health/fitness goals where desired.  The MyHealthGoals database allows a user of Appleâ€™s iPhone to unlock this data to provide additional information on maintaining a healthy lifestyle by understanding the baseline health measures and setting goals where improvement is desired.
